# C8E1-MySavings
Create a MySavings application that displays a menu of choices for entering pennies, nickels, dimes, and  quarters into a piggy bank and then prompts the user to make a selection. The MySavings application  should include a PiggyBank object that can add coins to the piggy bank, remove coins, and return the  total amount in the bank.
